Urls_organizer is a Python program that helps to organize a list of URLs. It can read URLs from a file or add a single URL, removes duplicate URLs, and sorts them in natural order.

Additionally, the program can validate the URLs by sending a GET request and checking for invalid URLs. The program uses **multiprocessing to speed up the validation process**, and the results are saved in a separate file. The output URL list can be saved in a file specified by the user. The program takes command-line arguments for its inputs and parameters. 

The purpose of the program is to assist users in managing their lists of URLs by keeping them organized and validating their accuracy.
